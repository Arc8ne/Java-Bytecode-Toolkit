# Java-Bytecode-Toolkit
The Java Bytecode Toolkit application was developed to assist developers and reverse engineers with analyzing Java class files, which are files containing various data about a Java class, including the bytecode instructions for each of the methods of the class.

Current features:
- Ability to view general information about a Java class file such as the number of constant pool entries, the number of fields, the number of methods, the number of attributes and many more pieces of information.
- Ability to export the data contained in a Java class file to an XML file containing the data represented in a human-readable format.

Planned (and upcoming) features:
- Disassembly (So as to allow users to view a human-readable representation of bytecode instructions that are present in a Java class file).
- Editing various information in a Java class file (e.g. editing bytecode instructions, editing fields or methods etc).
- Extended refactoring capabilities (e.g. renaming all occurrences of a certain variable).
- Searching for occurrences of a particular piece of text in one or more Java class files.
- Opening and viewing JAR files.
